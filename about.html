					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>&nbsp&nbspMy name is Megan DuPriest and I am an undergraduate research assistant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  I am working under the guidance of Dr. Gary Bishop and planning to graduate in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.  This was research done from May 2015 to December 2015. </p>

				<div id='aboutStudy'>
					<h2>Supporting the UNC Center of Learning and Disability in Research</h2>
					<p>&nbsp&nbspThis program was created to assist in the study done by Karen Erickson, Director of the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies. Her research wishes to study girls with <a href="https://www.rettsyndrome.org/">Rett Syndrome</a>, a postnatal neurological disorder generally characterized by loss of communication and motor skills. Her hope is that by using the Tobii PCEye Go, a device that captures eye movements across a computer screen, along with this software for data capture and analysis, we can prove that these girls are capable of greater things than previously imagined.  One of which is to have parents of children with Rett's syndrome read books to their child on a website called <a href="http://tarheelreader.org/">Tar Heel Reader</a> and capture the data of their eye movements and support their belief that these girls are capable of learning to read and much more.
